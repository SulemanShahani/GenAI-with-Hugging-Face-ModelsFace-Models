# NLP-Exploration-with-Hugging-Face-ModelsFace-Models


This project demonstrates the use of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and libraries to interact with and leverage large language models (LLMs) available on the Hugging Face model hub. It includes functionalities for prompt-based interactions with custom templates, text generation tasks, and exploration of pre-trained NLP models.

## Overview

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- Hugging Face Model Hub
- Langchain-huggingface
- Transformers Library
- Langchain Library
- Google Colab Environment
- Python Programming Language

## Features

1. **Hugging Face Model Hub Integration**: Access pre-trained LLMs from the Hugging Face model hub.
2. **Prompt-based Interaction**: Define custom templates for prompting LLMs and handle their responses.
3. **Text Generation**: Perform text generation tasks using state-of-the-art NLP models.
4. **Exploration of NLP Models**: Experiment with various NLP models and explore their capabilities.

## Installation
